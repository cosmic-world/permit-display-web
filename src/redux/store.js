// persistReducer takes two arguments:

// persistConfig: An object specifying the configuration for persisting the state.
// reducers: The root reducer of Redux application, here combineReducers()

// The devTools option with the process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production" condition ensures that Redux DevTools are enabled during development but disabled in production,
// following best practices for debugging and performance in different environments

// Including thunk middleware enables Redux to handle asynchronous actions, making it easier to manage side effects in Redux applications,
// such as fetching data from an API, handling timers, or interacting with browser APIs.
// It's a common choice for handling asynchronous behavior in Redux applications due to its simplicity and flexibility

// key: A string that serves as the key prefix for the stored state. This is used to namespace the persisted state within the storage.
// storage: The storage engine to be used for persisting the state. It can be sessionStorage, sessionStorage, or a custom storage engine compatible with the Redux Persist library
